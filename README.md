I'm a Full-Stack Web Developer with a degree in Software Engineering. Alongside my studies, I've gained a few years of hands-on experience through both work and academic projects. I've built a variety of applications, including institutional websites, e-commerce stores, and a platform that connects students with university professors for academic support, among others.

<summary><h3> My coding journey</h3></summary>
I began my coding journey in September 2019 as an intern at my cousinâ€™s web development agency â€” a small operation run out of a room in his house. It was there that I learned the fundamentals of web development, including PHP, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and MySQL. I also gained invaluable experience with GitHub, client support, prototyping, and working with Kanban workflows.
Over time, both my skills and the company grew. The team expanded to six people and we moved through three different office spaces. By 2024, I had worked with over 50 clients and earned my degree in Software Engineering. Feeling ready for a new challenge, I transitioned into a new role.
Since July 2024, Iâ€™ve been working on an ERP system project tailored for the agricultural market, this time as part of a much larger development team. While the projectâ€™s repository is private and I canâ€™t share many specifics, I can say that weâ€™re building it using Java Spring Boot, Vue.js, Git, and both PostgreSQL and Oracle databases.
